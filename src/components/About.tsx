            <strong>Peak Scrivening</strong> is a collection of 366 joke-writing tips shared by comedian 
            <strong> Gary Gulman</strong> throughout 2019 on Twitter (now X).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This project was created to make these valuable insights more accessible and searchable for comedy writers, 
            performers, and fans of Gary's work.

            <strong>Note:</strong> The quotes might not be 100% accurate due to the parsing process, which removed Twitter links 
            (now rebranded as X, so the links were basically dead) and didn't include images. If some context is lost on a quote, feel free to reach out to me by email and bring it to my attention. I will probably not change it, but, I might.
