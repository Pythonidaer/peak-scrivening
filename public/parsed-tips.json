Tell them if you've heard similar bits! 2 people is best more is ok. It's one of the most fun and helpful exercises.\n\nEven if your partner just gives you more confidence in a new joke/idea, it is INVALUABLE. A lot of times they will suggest excellent tags (additions to the joke usually but not limited to the punchline) or different angles. It also gives you a safe place to say things out loud.\n\nYou can generally disregard the first idea that pops into your head because it probably popped into many other heads too. Obvious punchlines are promiscuous. Don't be like the millionaire standup I heard about who used to run all his ideas and suddenly have to leave when it was his turn to listen and help.\n\nDon't feel like you have to be ALL BUSINESS and write the whole time. The best part of comedy is the friendships. Sometimes you just need someone to whine about club to. But, put a time limit on that too."

I will get some pushback and I will ignore it.\n\nWant to stand out? Avoid hacky topics. You know what they are. Unless you're Pryor I don't have time for your angle. But so-and-so said \"There's no hacky premise! It's what you blah blah blah.\" I disagree. No one's ever been accused of being too original.\n\nWatch the comics before and after you. The topics that keep getting brought up, Tinder, TSA are most likely hacky. Instead of accusing theft, write on a less pedestrian topic. You really have to be your own judge of these things. I don't feel comfortable being the arbiter of hackiness. Be strict with yourself. It will pay off later."

It is cowardly to have premises but never have a point.\n\nThe best stand ups are the ones who can go into any environment and figure it out. Alt, club, college, festival, rock show, etc\n\nJokes aren't truly good unless they're universal.\n\nWork for free until you don't have to work for free anymore. Then never work for free again. Going up at a small/low key/new/loose show to try brand new shit is not work, it's workshopping. It's ok to do that for free.\n\nIf a comic before you tells the audience they suck, that comic is weak. Try starting your set like this afterwards: \"Thank you guys for being here tonight. And thanks for giving me a little bit of your time.\" You will instantly feel their guards come down. They're just happy someone (specifically, a mediocre comedian) is not calling them dumb for being there.\n\nYou work for the audience, the audience does not work for you.\n\nThe hardest type of gig, by far, is opening for a band on an all music bill.\n\nWhen you don't take enough time to live a real life, your jokes start to feel stale and thin. Sometimes the best joke writers demonstrate an insane amount of skill at writing and telling a joke, but the joke isn't about anything since they don't go and live life. (I have the opposite problem. Too much bouncing around life, not enough discipline in writing.)\n\nMaking jokes about the clothes you chose to wear on stage is cheap.\n\nIn New York, comedians can be too cutthroat. In Los Angeles, they can be too cocky. In the United Kingdom, they can be too sad.\n\nWhen you go on the road, sign up for a frequent flier program and stick with that airline.\n\nSometimes you won't sell tickets on the road. They'll give away a ton of tickets (paper the room). Those shows can be fun because if you get them on your side, you know you've appealed to them more than the mozzarella sticks.\n\nNever underestimate young people. If you feel like young audiences are too PC, there's something to be said for \"Maybe you need to find a smarter way to make your point.\"\n\nComedians are allowed to say whatever they want. But comedians forget that the other side of that is that audiences are allowed to be offended.\n\nBeing a comedian is not a hard life and we need to stop claiming that it is. It's insulting to people who have actual hard lives. Working hard in an industry where success is unlikely and where your ego gets shredded is daunting, but it's not hard. Being a miner or an auto plant worker is hard. That's why it's an honor to make the working class laugh.\n\nWe need to give each other as artists some element of a magicians' code. Go all-city, like the old school graffiti artists.\n\nI have no interest in bad art with good politics, or good art with bad politics.\n\nBeing an artist is not an excuse to sleep all day and drink all night.\n\nTry other forms of art sometimes too. In college I took a modern dance class as a joke, and was stunned to realize it was probably the first period that I had accelerated growth as a comedian.\n\nIf you want to live a life with no rules imposed via others, it's on you to install your own discipline into your routine.\n\nNo show is more important than any other show.\n\nImitate your heroes in your early days, but remember that the best type of imitation is emotional imitation. At it's best, you won't imitate their writing style. You won't imitate how they behaved. You will imitate how they made you feel.\n\nThe true art of stand up comedy is learning how to burp into a microphone without anyone in the crowd hearing it.\n\nDon't act like a comedian, act like yourself.\n\nwww.chrisgeth.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ChrisGethard/status/1108467137230917633\nhttps://medium.com/@chrisgeth/my-personal-opinions-regarding-what-i-do-8070ae57f911"

    "text": "106) READ and HEED! This essay by @Kurt_Vonnegut has gotten me through so many rough times. Print it and tack it up where you can see it when you need it. #LIFEVEST Thanks for gifting me this @thenickgriffin! FOREWORD I sometimes say in lectures that I suffer from \"survivor's syndrome,\" but not because of the Battle of the Bulge or the firebombing of Dresden in World War II, man-made calamities during or after which I saw more corpses than you can shake a stick at. A young woman complained to me after my lecture about that war, evidently feeling incomplete, that she had never seen a dead person. I made a joke. I said to her, \"Be patient.\" I do feel lousy, however, about the many passionate and gifted artists I know or knew, writers, painters and composers, dancers and comedians, actors and actresses, singers and cartoonists, who died or are dying in obscurity, more often than not in poverty. To quote the humorist Kin Hubbard: \"It's no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.\" Audiences failed these friends and acquaintances of mine. Audiences were too barbarous and inattentive to realize how good they were and to reward them with sustained applause and a living wage. I am reminded of a cartoon of long ago which depicted war as a rouged, warty old whore. She says to a youth about seventeen years old, \"Hello, Sonny. I knew your Dad.\" She could represent the arts instead of war, and the cartoon would make just as much sense to a lot of people. The creation of works of art that a sizeable audience may appreciate and even pay for isn't all that different from an attack by either side in World War I, in which thousands of brave, good-hearted young people left their trenches at dawn, and practically everybody wound up draped over barbwire, or drowning face down in water at the bottom of a shellhole. Again: I suffer from “survivor’s syndrome.” Anyone who survives a human wave attack against such daunting odds, whether in war or the arts, does do because of dumb luck. Agility and courage and character, or whatever, have nothing to do with how it all turns out. Gifted artists have to be what they are, have to do what they do the way they do it. Whether they earn a living and fame thereby is a matter of happening by chance upon breaks in the barbwire, unswept by machinegun fire. So to speak. Mark Twain, a better writer and human being than I am, marveled, when an old man like me, at the durability of his works' popularity. He thought this might be due to his willingness to moralize. It was lucky for him that moralizing paid off so handsomely. In any case, Mark Twain was simply born to moralize. I think I was, too. When I look back at my incredibly lucky career as a writer, it seems that there was never time to think. It was as though I were skiing down a steep and hazardous mountain slope. When I look back at the marks my skis made in the snow on the way down, I only now realize that I wrote again and again about people who behaved decently in an indecent society. I received a letter from a sappy woman a while back. She knew I was sappy, too, which is to say a New Deal Democrat. She was pregnant. She wanted to know if it was a bad thing to bring an innocent little baby into a world as awful as this one is. I replied that what made living almost worthwhile for me were the saints I met. They could be anywhere. There were people who behaved decently in an indecent society. Perhaps, you, dear reader, are or will become a saint for her child to meet. I thank you for your attention.
